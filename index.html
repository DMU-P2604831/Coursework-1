<p>Arthur Fleck is a failing comedian who has a disorder that makes him laugh at unfitting times. Having been attacked by a group of kids his colleague Randall gives him a hand gun for his own protection, however his gun slipped out during a kids party leading him to get fired. On his way home on the subway 3 drunk men who work for Wayne Enterprise are killed by him as they were beating him up. The killings are condemned by Thomas Wayne, calling people envious of successful people ‘clowns’. Protests against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters wearing clown masks resembling Arthur. The social service program funds have been cut, leaving Arthur without his medication. He finds out from Thomas that his mother Penny has a mental illness and that he is adopted and him and his mother were abused by her boyfriend. Being devastated, he enters Sophie’s apartment, a woman who he thinks he’s in a relationship with, ends up being told to leave, figuring out that his relationship was his imagination. The next day he kills Penny. Invited to the Murray show, he attends knowing that he was invited to only be mocked. Eventually killing Murray on live tv. Arthur is arrested for murder but a riot has started when lead to the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne and the Arthur being freed from the police vehicle with the help of the rioters. </p>
